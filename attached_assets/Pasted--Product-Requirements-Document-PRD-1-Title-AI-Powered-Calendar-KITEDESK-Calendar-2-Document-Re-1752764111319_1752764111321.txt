3. Purpose
Provide an AI-driven calendar app that unifies multiple calendar sources (Google, Lark, CalDAV/ICS, etc.), enabling users to manage, schedule, and optimize events through natural language interaction and intelligent suggestions.
4. Problem Statement
- Users have problems with organizing his/her calendar, often forget or miss calendar events.
- Existing apps lack robust natural language(AI) scheduling and cross-platform integration. If you can speak directly to AI, and let it manage the calendar, things could be much easier. 
5. Goals & Objectives
- Unified View: Aggregate events from all connected calendars into a single interface.
- Natural Language Scheduling: Enable users to create, modify, or delete events via conversational AI inputs.
- Smart Recommendations: Suggest optimal times, detect conflicts, and offer automated rescheduling.
- Personalisation: Backed by LLM, consistent memory and

6. User Personas
- Busy Professional (Alice): Manages work meetings (Google Workspace) and personal events (Apple/iCal). Needs quick rescheduling when conflicts arise.
- Not Good at Organzing Stuff(Pete): Pete is not good at organzing stuff and often miss meetings. He wished he could have an assistant to help manage the calendar.
